![The beauty-pageant mockumentary “Drop Dead Gorgeous,” starring Ellen Barkin, Allison Janney, and Kirsten Dunst, has transformed from a flop into a venerated artifact of Y2K-era camp.](https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d1681a47ee4a30008869919/master/w_1626,c_limit/Tolentino-Drop-Dead-Gorgeous.jpg)

**“Drop Dead Gorgeous,”** the mockumentary about a teen-age beauty pageant in the fictional town of Mount Rose, Minnesota, was released in 1999. Made for somewhere between ten and fifteen million dollars, it earned just ten and a half million in theatres. In the _Times_, Janet Maslin wrote that the movie contained “what may be a record number of miserably unfunny jokes.” In _L.A. Weekly_, Manohla Dargis declared that it had “no metaphoric resonance, no ostensible target, and finally, no purpose outside of its own existence.”

In the San Francisco Examiner, Wesley Morris called it “relentlessly defective” and suggested that, given the dearth of mainstream movies about the poor white underclass, it “should be renamed ‘Drop Dead Ghetto’ and hauled off to the ‘Jerry Springer’ hall of shame.”

They weren’t entirely wrong. The movie is full of stereotypes, actively offensive toward nearly every American subgroup, and occasionally disgusting—at one point, pageant hopefuls, hanging over hotel balconies, vomit pink globs of shellfish en masse. And, yet, for two decades, whenever I’ve said “Drop Dead Gorgeous,” it’s invariably been followed by the words ~“is possibly my favorite movie of all time.”~

For twenty years, it’s existed only as a physical artifact, mostly lost in the no man’s land of VHS and DVD cabinets. But it has recently become available on YouTube for rental or purchase, and, on Friday, just ahead of its 20^th^ anniversary, it will come to a streaming network (Hulu) for the first time. **_I_** am one of [many, many people](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_(TV_series)>) who have been anticipating this development with deep gratitude and relief.

Now that the movie is once again widely available, I hope that another generation of loving, sadistic, ridiculous teen-agers comes to know it. Young people today seem to have a native understanding of the tension between calculation and naturalness that has always defined beauty pageants and that now defines much of identity performance in general. They’ve grown up steeped in the absurd darkness that this tension produces. They already know what “Drop Dead Gorgeous” showed me when I was a ninth-grader: that the smile of a beauty queen, the glinting crown and the heaps of flowers, always holds the faint scent of bloodlust, and a whisper of the grave.
